				<p>This is the first micro-film I directed in April, 2013. After further study about film production, I found it may need a lot of improvements. :P But I really enjoyed the time when I made such attempt with several teammates and made progress by practicing. As a result of our efforts, the film won First Prize at Beijing 2013 College Student Psychology Short Film Contest at that time. :) </p>
